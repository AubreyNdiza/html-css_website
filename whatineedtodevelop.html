		<h2>What Do I Need To Develop?</h2>
		<p>There are a few number of areas of development that I have identified. Now that I have Identified these, it is vital to work on immediately and I am. Time management is the first most crucial one. Secondly, in alignment with time management, I need to learn how to implement plans effectively. I also need to learn how to delegate tasks and put trust in those I delegate to. Lastly, I strongly believe that I need to ask how to help when I need it at the most.</p>
